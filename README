This is an anki plugin that scrapes a field of an anki deck and glosses
the content of that field using wwwjdic's glossing feature, and makes a
new deck out of the glosses.

This turned out to be a terrible idea. The glossing service does not do
morphological analysis, and thus can't determine the correct reading.
The result is a very inaccurate representation of that deck's vocabulary.

A better idea would be to use mecab, and then find definitions or sentences
for the words in some other way. In any case, the concept of senseless
generation of vocab decks is typically frowned upon, so this was not a
great idea to begin with. The code is kept here for future reference on
some techniques used to interact with anki programmatically.
